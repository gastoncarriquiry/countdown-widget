# Countdown Widget

This repository contains a countdown widget developed with Javascript and jQuery. At the moment dates input is only available through code manipulation.

## Features

- Add more than one date and when one is completed the next one is automatically queued up.
- When all dates are completed the timer hides.

## Installation
Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/gastoncarriquiry/countdown-widget.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd proyecto-vecindario
```

Run it live!

## Development

Want to contribute? Great! There are a few options that could be developed:

- User interface for adding new event dates.
- Automatic date sorting (currently dates have to be manually ordered in the event dates array).
- Event information -- right now events only display dates, but it could include event title, description, etc.
- Whatever you may think of! Suggesstions are encouraged.
